# Contributor guidelines


If you have ideas for improving this project, we would love to hear from you!  

## Report an issue, bug, or feature request

Here are the [steps to creating an issue on github](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart).  When reporting a bug,

- search for related issues on Github. You might be able to get answer without the hassle of creating an issue
- describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.  
  - (if applicable) provide error messages
  - (if applicable) provide a step by step description of the problem; if possible include code that others can use to reproduce it
  - You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
  - provide clear, specific title
  - include details on your setup (operating system, python version, etc.)
- use the most recent version of this library and the source language (e.g. Rust); that fixes a lot of problems  
- here are [more details on getting the most out of issue reporting!](https://marker.io/blog/how-to-write-bug-report)

## Contribute new code

Here is a [step-by-step guide to writing new code, and submiting it to the project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)

The more you know about a software library, the easier it is to get started writing code.  The best way to learn about this project is its the documentation!  See `README.md` to get started.
